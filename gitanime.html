       <p class="firstpara">Anime is ironic in it self as despite being the cartoon category(THe animation guys wouldn't agree with the anime being compared to cartoon)
          still for the common people it appears more as a cartoon which we used to watch when we were of 8-10 years, but the best thing here
          is that despite being the cartoon the dialogues in anime are at an totally diffferent league and can be compared to that of jokers in the
          Batman series .If you try to understand the dialogues they could leave you speechless and the amount of efforts these people out there in the
          animated world can be a splendid motivation for even your daily life if you have the sense of realting it.</p><br>
